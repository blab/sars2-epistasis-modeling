# Mutational fitness model

Using the sequence counts in `../count-data/pango_location-variant-sequence-counts.tsv` and mutations given from `../mutations-by-variant/accumulated_mutations_output.tsv`, we fit a mutational fitness model with [evofr](https://github.com/blab/evofr).

Note: To fit this model with evofr, you will need to build and install from the master branch at [evofr](https://github.com/blab/evofr).
